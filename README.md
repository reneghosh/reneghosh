# About me

I am René Ghosh, a developper specialized in front-web application development and devops. 

I am currently working on [cards](https://github.com/satelliteray/cards/) (name susceptible to change), a framework for building card-based web user interfaces, quickly, reliably, and simply.

I am interested in PWA applications and a staunch believer in standards.

My homepage is at https://satelliteray.github.io
