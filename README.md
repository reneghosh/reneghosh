# About me

I am Ren√© Ghosh, a fullstack and devops developper. 

I am currently working on [cards](https://github.com/reneghosh/cards/) (name susceptible to change), a framework for building card-based web user interfaces, quickly, reliably, and simply.

I am interested in PWA applications and a staunch believer in standards.

My homepage is at https://reneghosh.github.io
